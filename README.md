# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this repository, we are utilizing GeoJSON, JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create semi-interactive maps that you are able to zoom in and out of, toggle earthquakes locations and map types. 

## Image of earthquake heat maps on street style view
By using Mapbox's API, we are able to look at the earthquake's heat map. This shows where earthquakes were with the last 7 days of this upload.

## Image of tetonic plates
Here we are looking at the dark mode from Mapbox and the tectonic plate lines. This dives in further to see what the proximity of earthquakes are in correlation to where the plates are.
